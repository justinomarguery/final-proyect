				SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM

				BMW engine failures can result from manufacturing defects, poor maintenance, or component wear. A solution involves both preventive measures and corrective actions. First, BMW should enhance its manufacturing quality control to eliminate defective components, such as faulty timing chains, oil pumps, and cooling systems, during production. Stricter testing of critical engine parts would help reduce defects reaching consumers.

To prevent failures, BMW owners must follow a strict maintenance schedule, including regular oil changes, coolant flushes, and using high-quality fuel. BMW could also send alerts for common engine issues based on model, mileage, and service history, encouraging early intervention before problems worsen.

BMW should offer extended warranties or service packages that cover critical engine parts, strengthening customer trust. Addressing known defects through free or discounted repairs would further improve the customer experience. Additionally, providing detailed diagnostics and solutions via dealer networks and mobile apps can empower owners to take timely action. Expanding access to OEM parts and collaborating with independent mechanics would help reduce repair costs.

By improving manufacturing quality, offering proactive maintenance solutions, and providing customer support, BMW can reduce engine failures and enhance the ownership experience.
